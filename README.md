C# Exoplanet Library: Reads various archives and provides plot and scatter plot visualization

I started this project to learn to use the XML reading, writing and verification on load.  I also want to do some simple line plots of the
exoplanet data and well as scratter plots of the same data.  So for plotting, I searched for a c# library that would do what I wanted.  I
ended up using NPLOT, because it had axis labeling, line plots, point plots, log axis, etc.

The source of the data is from several sites that have various text files that can be down loaded from the web.
